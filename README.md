# Struct

PHP is lacking a `struct` data type. The simplest method is a class with public properties, however that seems a little too simplistic for me.

This repo is a simple experiment to showhow easy it is to implement a struct data type with immutable properties, utilising PHP 7 syntax.

Check out the tests and especially the stub classes to understand how this thought experiment works.

This isn't available on packagist, and I imagine it won't be.
